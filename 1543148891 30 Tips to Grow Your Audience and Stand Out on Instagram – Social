With Instagram, you can get super creative when it comes to competitions and you’re only limited by your imagination. Here are a few common mechanics used by brands:



	
1. Photo sharing contest: In these types of contests, you ask your followers to share a photo using a selected hashtag (so you can discover all entries). These contests tend to have a set theme.

2. Comments contents: With this contest mechanic, you ask your followers to comment on your post to enter the contest. You can also encourage users to tag a friend in the comments to enter — this can help to increase the virality of the post.



	
3. Likes contest: This is probably the easiest contest to get up and running — simply liking your photo will enter someone into your contest. The major benefit of this simplicity is that there’s no barrier to entry and it’ll only take your followers a second to double tap and like your post.
