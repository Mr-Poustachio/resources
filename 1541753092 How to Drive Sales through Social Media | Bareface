There's obviously a lot to think about when it comes to social. Even though having a brand presence on social has been around for a long time now, a lot of brands are still focusing on how many likes they have or how big their following is. Yes, having a large following might be an indicator of your success and reach, but a huge amount of page likes doesn't always translate into a successful social media presence or the ability to drive sales through social.
