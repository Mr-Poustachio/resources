Use visuals: Visual content has significantly higher engagement rate than standard text or even link posts.



	
Ask for the share: Just like in sales, if you ask for the share, you may just get it. Some studies show a significant increase in engagement when you actually ask for it.



	
Mention people: By using social network @mentions allows you to grab someone’s attention by sending them a notification. Kind of like saying, “Hey, I’m talking about you over here,” or, “Hey, I quoted you over here!” You’re guaranteed at least to get their attention and hopefully they’ll want to help you spread the word as well.



	
Ask Questions: Asking questions gives people a directed way to engage. This way they have to do much less cognitive work to come up with something to say, because you’ve given them a clear direction in how you want them to engage.
