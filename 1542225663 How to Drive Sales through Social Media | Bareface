You heard me right. The days of you reaching any significant percentage of your audience for free is gone. There are the rare posts that "go viral" with little or no help, but these tend to be the exception rather than the rule. If you decide you want to be on a social media platform, you should probably dedicate some of your marketing budget to help it along the way.
>> Pay to play is certainly needed. Whether that means paying for eyeballs directly or paying someone that will create an excessive amount of engaging content. Whch takes experience to do effectively.


	
Social media should be treated with the same care as any other marketing tactic. It shouldn't be a last minute "oh sh*t, I need to post something" situation. If you want to drive sales through social, then getting the basics right first is imperative.

Is it possible to drive sales through social media? The short answer is yes ... sometimes.

Some business will find it easier to drive sales through social media directly than others and there a variety of reasons for this.
>> You have to be creative. You cannot just copy.


	
If you have a Facebook advertising account, they will create a "tracking pixel" for you that will allow Facebook to track the behaviour of users on your site. You can then create an audience in your advert account based on those behaviours.



	
For example, I could create an audience called "Social Media" and have Facebook collate all of the people who visit the Bareface website and view articles about social media or look at the Social Media service page, like so:



	
I could then create an ad about services relating to social media and choose to deliver that ad to this audience. You see, we have an active audience that knows who Bareface is, they are interested in social media as a service and might want some help. I feel a little bit like the masked magician at this point, revealing the dark secrets of advertisers, but this is all to help you. I promise.



	
Like many things in marketing, setting this up is going to be the most difficult part. If you don't have any technical knowledge, the simple task of getting a tracking code in the correct place on your site can seem like a mountain to climb. If you have a website developer or marketing agency, simply make it their problem (or our problem). If you don't then there are lots of good tutorials on YouTube that can guide you through the process step by step. Putting in the effort initially will benefit you massively in the long run because once it is done, it requires little to no maintenance and continues to provide you with returns long into the future.
