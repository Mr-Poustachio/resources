2. Inspire your followers to get outside and get moving.

Did you know that exercise can have a massive effect on our brains?
Just 30 mins a day can improve cognitive function, lower anxiety levels, increase memory capability AND boost your mood, yeow!

Technology is fast becoming a huge part of our lives, and for most people it means more time spent in front of a screen. Set a great example and motivate others to make it part of a daily routine.






13. Who is someone that inspires you everyday?

Showcase someone who you admire, post an image of their work and describe why they light you up from the inside!

Talk about how they motivate you, and why you’re so inspired and look up to them. Although you might not have met in person, this is a great way to acknowledge someone’s direct influence in your life.
