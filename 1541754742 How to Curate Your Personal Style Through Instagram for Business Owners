In a recent Clubhouse masterclass about passion projects, I dished out that Instagram is one of my ongoing art projects. In all seriousness, I use my Instagram feed as a way to cultivate a beautiful life, and practice some iPhone-ography and filter magic to curate a little body of work that does little more than simply bring me happiness and continually inspire me to seek out the beauty in my life and live in the moment. You can find my feed @emilym_thompson on Instagram.



	
Take a look at what’s going on around you. Be an observer of your own present moment or the things you’ve captured of moments past. Look at the colors, subjects (like plants or shoes), shapes – what is your life already telling you about what you’re interested in and who you are visually?
