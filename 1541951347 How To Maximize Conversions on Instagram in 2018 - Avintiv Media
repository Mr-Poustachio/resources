Instagram is the shiny window display for your products and services. Think of your grid as the first impression you want to convey before consumers set foot in the door (or their mouse hits your page).

ZZZZZZZ

	
If you can find a way to deliver compelling content to your target audience without bombarding them with obnoxious sales pitches, you’ll do well. In fact, 65% of top-performing Instagram posts feature products. Consumerism has blossomed on Instagram and users certainly aren’t opposed to it, as long as you can package it in an engaging way.
>> It's easy to mix up your content to be profitable and entertaining. They compliment eachother.


	
It’s difficult to measure conversion rates or ROI (return on investment) when it comes to organic social media reach. It’s not always as simple as posting a call-to-action and analyzing the subsequent conversions.
>> Getting more views is better than none. 



	
A unique brand voice and aesthetic is crucial. If you copy what’s ‘popular’ on Instagram and evade authenticity, you’ll end up in the depths of oversaturated content when you really want to stand out. Communicate your brand’s story through your captions.



	
Secondly, you must identify your buyers. Really think hard about who they are and what their mindset may be. For every post you should picture the persona you’re talking to and put yourself in their shoes. What are their interests, wants, needs?



	
Having authority in your field builds consumer trust which in turn drives sales.

Informational content isn’t just for your blog. Not every follower has the time or energy to ‘click the link in bio’ to read your article. But they’re much more likely to read over a snippet of information in an Instagram caption and engage with a post that provides them value.

Tag related accounts and the location of or around your business.

Posts with a location actually acquire 79% more engagement. So, wherever possible include a location in your post. Tagging relevant accounts can also increase your post’s visibility.
