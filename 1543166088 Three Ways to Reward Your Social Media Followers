Feature a Follower

You can always write a blog about your most loyal social media follower. There will always be that one person who likes, comments, and shares the most. Feature him/her, and if you like, reward him with a free product or service. Not only will it show how deeply you care and appreciate the people supporting you, but it will also remind you that without them, your business will cease to exist. This reward also gives you some new content to create, which is helpful if youâ€™re all out.
